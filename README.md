# 🌱 Sustainable Fertilizer Usage Optimizer for Higher Yield

A data-driven dashboard designed to help farmers and agricultural stakeholders optimize fertilizer usage for maximum crop yield while promoting environmental sustainability.

## 📊 Project Overview

This dashboard analyzes soil health, crop type, and fertilizer application patterns to recommend optimal usage strategies. Built with Python, Streamlit, and scikit-learn, it empowers users to make informed decisions that balance productivity and sustainability.

## 🚀 Features

- 📈 Predictive modeling using Random Forest Regressor
- 🧪 Soil and crop input interface
- 🌿 Sustainable usage recommendations
- 📉 Visualizations of yield vs. fertilizer impact
- ☁️ Cloud deployment via Streamlit

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn)
- Streamlit
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Git & GitHub

## 📦 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sustainable-fertilizer-optimizer.git
